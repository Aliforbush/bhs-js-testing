  <p>Pick a problem set: <select id="problem_sets">
    <option disabled selected value="">
      Pick a problem set.
    </option>
  </select></p>
  <div id="instructions">
    <p>To start, pick a problem set from the menu above. You will implement the
    functions needed in the problem set in <code>script.js</code> and then use
    the ReplIt <b class="run">Run ▶</b> button to re-evaluate your code. Once
    you have picked a problem set, this web page will run the tests for one or
    more of the functions you have defined in <code>script.js</code>. It will
    also tell you which functions you still need to define to complete the
    problem set.</p>
    <p>You can focus on one problem at a time by clicking the buttons that will
    appear once you pick a problem set. Click the selected problem again to go
    back to seeing the results for all functions or pick another problem by
    clicking on a different button.</p>
    <p>Note also that the ReplIt console tab below will have your code loaded
    so you can invoke functions there to try things out. Just remember that
    whenever you make changes to your code, you have to hit the <b class=
    "run">Run ▶</b> button before the new definitions will be available in the
    console. In the console the up and down arrow keys will walk through the
    history of expressions you have typed previously so you don't have to
    retype them.</p>
