Playing around with some Javascript testing infra for replit.com.

## Key keyboard and menu shortcuts

- Right click in code context menu -> Format Document: reformats code to be properly indented. Also on Shift-Option-f (⇧⌥F)
- Control-a to move to beginning of line
- Control-e to move to end of line
- ⌘-] to indent current line; ⌘-[ to deindent. (TAB also indents if the cursor is at the beginning of the line and Shift-TAB deindents anywhere in the line, the same as ⌘-[.)
- ⌘-/ to comment or uncomment selected lines. (Affects all lines that have any part selected so you don't need to worry about selecting all of the first and last lines.)
- ⌘-z to undo.
- Double click with mouse to select a word.
- Triple click with a mouse to select a whole line.
- Shift and movement commands extends the selection. (So a quick way to select a bunch of lines is to triple click in the first line to select it and then hold shift and click at the end of the last line or even triple click the last line.)
