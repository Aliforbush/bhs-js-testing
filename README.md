# bhs-js-testing

Use this project to check your Javascript implementations of the TK problems. The only file you need to worry about is `script.js` which is where you will write your code.

When you click Run it will render a web page that will test any functions you have defined for which we have defined test cases and will tell you the names of the functions that there are test cases for that you have not yet implemented.

You can also choose to only run the tests for a specific function by giving a value to the variable `workingOn` in `script.js`.

You are of course free to look at the other files in this project but you do not need to understand them to write our own code.


## Key keyboard and menu shortcuts

- In code files, at the top right there's a small icon, a black square with horizontal white lines. Click it to automatically reformat your code. It adjusts indentation and other spacing issues. If after clicking it your code looks weirdly indented it's likely because have a missing or extra curly brace. You can also invoke auto format with ⇧⌥F. Keeping your code well-formatted will make it much easier to understand its structure.
- Control-a to move to beginning of line.
- Control-e to move to end of line.
- ⌘-] to indent current line; ⌘-[ to deindent. (TAB also indents if the cursor is at the beginning of the line and Shift-TAB deindents anywhere in the line, the same as ⌘-[.)
- ⌘-/ to comment or uncomment selected lines. (Affects all lines that have any part selected so you don't need to worry about selecting all of the first and last lines.)
- ⌘-z to undo.
- Double click with mouse to select a word.
- Triple click with a mouse to select a whole line.
- Shift and movement commands extends the selection. (So a quick way to select a bunch of lines is to triple click in the first line to select it and then hold shift and click at the end of the last line or even triple click the last line.)
