# bhs-js-testing

Use this project to check your Javascript implementations of the functions in the problem sets SL 1-10, SL 11-20, SL 21-30, Eat Cake!, HL F/M/R, and HL Recursion. The only file you need to worry about is `script.js` which is where you will write your code.

When you click Run it will render a web page that will let you choose a problem set and test any functions you have defined for which we have defined test cases and will tell you the names of the functions that there are test cases for that you have not yet implemented.

You are of course free to look at the other files in this project but you do not need to understand them to write and test your own code.


## Important keyboard and menu shortcuts

There are a few features of ReplIt that will make dealing with your code a lot easier. It's worth spending a bit of time to get familiar with them. 

- **Autoformatting** In Javascript files, at the top right there's a small icon, a black square with horizontal white lines. Click it to automatically reformat your code, adjusting indentation and other spacing issues. If after clicking it your code looks weirdly indented it's likely because of a missing or extra curly brace. You can also invoke auto format with the key comba ⇧⌥F. Get in the habit of clicking the auto-format button regularly; keeping your code well-formatted will make it much easier for you and others to understand its structure.

- **Indentation** Occasionally you'll just want to indent or dedent the line you are on. The key commands ⌘-] to indent the current line and ⌘-[ to deindent are very handy. (TAB also indents, but only if the cursor is at the beginning of the line. Shift-TAB deindents anywhere in the line, the same as ⌘-[.)

- **Bulk commenting** The key combo ⌘-/ comments and uncomments selected lines. It affects all lines that have any part selected so you don't need to worry about selecting all of the first and last lines.

- **Selection** You'll often have to move code around. There are short cuts to make it easier to manage selecting code to avoid lots of tedious mousing. Double click with the mouse to select a word and triple click to select a whole line. Also note that if you hold the Shift key, movement commands extend the selection. So, for instance, a quick way to select a bunch of lines is to triple click in the first line and then hold shift and hit the down arrow several times.

- **Moving the cursor** You'll also spend a lot of time moving your cursor around. A few key combos that are very handy are Control-a to move to the beginning of the current line and Control-e to move to the end. (Note that Control is the key with a ^ on it, different than the command key with the ⌘). Those two key combos come from an ancient text editor called Emacs but work in a suprising number of programs. Control-g in ReplIt pops up a window where you can type a line number and it will jump your cursor to that line.
